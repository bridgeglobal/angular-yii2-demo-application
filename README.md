# angular-yii2-demo-application
This is a demo application module that does CRUD operations for a user who is then assigned for different regions of his work. 
The user is specified as 'Post Person' in the application. 
A logged in user can perform the CRUD operations for the Post-Person, add all of the regions for him/her, and has an activity-
calendar in which the logged in user can add Holidays in his work.
